# SSH model with quasiperiodic hopping terms.
codes about a ssh model with quasiperiodic hopping terms, topology and localization transition are studied.\

## main function
main1: loclization-delocalization transition /mobility edges.\
main2: real space topological invariant and edge modes\

## functions
Hssh: generate the Hamiltonian (SSH model). \
Hssh_disorder: generate the Hamiltonian (SSH model with quasiperiodic hopping terms).\
r_v: calculate the topological invariant in the real space.\
